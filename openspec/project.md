# Project Context

## Purpose
A modern, dark-themed React website for Thollarkings Solar, a solar energy solutions company. The website serves as a digital presence showcasing services, company information, and providing a contact mechanism for potential clients.

## Tech Stack
- React 18 (with hooks)
- Vite (build tool and dev server)
- React Router DOM (client-side routing)
- Framer Motion (animations and transitions)
- Lucide React (icons)
- EmailJS (email service integration)
- CSS3 (custom styling)
- ESLint (code linting)

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- JavaScript with JSX syntax
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Component-based architecture
- PascalCase for component names

### Architecture Patterns
- Single Page Application (SPA) using React Router
- Component composition with reusable UI components
- Page-based routing structure (/home, /about, /contact)
- Separation of concerns: components, pages, and styles
- Framer Motion for declarative animations

### Testing Strategy
No formal testing framework implemented yet. Manual testing and ESLint for code quality checks.

### Git Workflow
